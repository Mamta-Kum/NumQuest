This questionnaire provides a frame for describing verbal numeral systems cross-linguistically.
It comprises of various forms related to the type of numeral systems and expressions along with
the considering syntactic and semantic domains. It consists of a number of analytical questions
for a succinct analysis of numerals in the language in question. This questionnaire is an
important tool for gathering information about the structure and usage of numeral systems
across various languages.

It can also be used to explore the cognitive tool of recursive numeral systems and the
efficiency of different numeral systems across languages. The questionnaire can document the
various numeral systems, focusing on the genetic classification, phonological systems, and
counting concepts of human languages. As those of dominant languages have rapidly replaced
the traditional numeral systems of small languages, it is an urgent task to document these
important linguistic data before they are completely forgotten.
